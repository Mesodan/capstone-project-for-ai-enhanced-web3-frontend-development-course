EXPERIENCE
SECTION 1: HTML
1. I have no access to chatgpt plus, so i made use of the chatgpt 3.5 which generated html code with Css. i couldn't upload images as well to indicate background color needed.  Later, i made us of google AI 'Gemini'. i can upload images here but html customize code still contain Css with prompt and i was informed with this exact words "Remember, this is just the HTML structure. Functionality like minting tokens will require JavaScript and web3 integration outside the scope of HTML alone."
